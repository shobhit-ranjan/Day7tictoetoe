# Day7tictoetoe

here we have to play a game tictactoe with the computer.

And we have different UC(Use Case) for that and we are implement it.


All the branches for different UC


Here we have two players where they can select there symbole to play (X or 0)


then if there is match in a single line or in any diagonal then that player wins the game.
